Placeholder text : <!--TODO - MUST DO THIS, write a good intro--><br>
I am supposed to write an intro here, but I am still busy setting up my website.
So for now just use this link "see my CV", to well...see my CV, and this link to "about me", for more
information on the person I am.


Thank you : )

## :fontawesome-solid-briefcase: Experience

### Tutoring

I have worked as a private, as well as part time employed, tutor since
2020 and honestly If I could I would Teach at a formal institute, as I really
enjoy teaching as much as I enjoy learning.
Subjects include: University; mathematics, physics and chemistry, and
Highschool; mathematics and physical science (physics, chemistry, etc.)
This includes letters of reference from past clients.

### Lab work

I must state clearly that as of now (2022) I do not have experience from
employment. However, **I do have laboratory** experience from practical
work in my studies, as well as working on my own chemistry projects with
my own apparatus and reagents (limited that may be).
In order to gain experience, you need employment, but in order to get
employment you need experience. Although I am confident that my
ability speaks for itself.

## :fontawesome-solid-flask-vial: Skills

### Lab hand

Capable lab assistant for setting up apparatus and glassware, titration,
A/B extraction, solvent separation, filtration via pump or gravity and
preparing solutions of required concentration.

Cleaning glassware and preparation of strong cleaning agent (e.g.,
piranha solution) if need be.

<!-- TODO: "Spiles"? Not spills? SPELL CHECK EVERYTHING -->
General knowledge of lab safety, equipment and reagents used in spiles
or emergencies.

General knowledge of common apparatus and glassware usage.
I own a small-scale personal lab, and along with my formal lab training
from practical work, I am familiar with the general chemistry laboratory
environment.
