## :fontawesome-solid-briefcase: Experience

### Tutoring

I have worked as a private and part time employed tutor since 2020. If I
could, I would Teach at a formal institute, as I really enjoy teaching as much
as I enjoy learning. Subjects I Teach include:
University; mathematics, physics and chemistry, and Highschool; math and
physical science. This includes letters of reference from past clients.

### Lab work
I have Laboratory Experience In may synthesis and procedures; e.g., in
saponification, nitrating, synthesis of aspirin and extraction of caffeine from
tea. I have Also Funded and conducted my own experiments and synthesis,
for the following:

1. solvated electrons experiment and condensation of ammonia

2. teaching titrations to students

3. Nitrating of cellulose, to make nitrocellulose

4. saponification to make soap, and

5. fractional distillation of mixed hydrocarbons.
