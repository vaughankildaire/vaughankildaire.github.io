My love for teaching and explaining concepts to others is ultimately and an excellent understanding of the subjects I have studied, naturally lead me to become a tutor. I find communication with students easy as there I have learnt to adapt my mindset to the age and demographic in question, also in a social setting I enjoy conversation of a wide spectrum of topics of varying diversity.</p> <p>Odd as it may seem, I have had a rather Interesting and long path in life. From art and animation, to the decent into depression, climbing back out and changing my profession, and finally at the end of my studies (for now) in Physics and Chemistry of all things. But I am happy with the choice I have made and the path I have made for myself. Traditionally one usually has one particular field or profession in mind, however If my life was not finite, I really would have liked to have attempted to work in multiple different fields, learn about them and perfect my trade. However, from my view a large part of the world is and its inner workings are rooted in, so it is to me worth devoting my life to.</p> <p>Something that I must admit is that I have a drive to be better than others in my own field, not in a maniacal or unhealthy fashion, just as a measure or standard to reach and if possible, surpass. I hope this honest is not to my own detriment, but what I\u2019m trying to say is that trying ones best to be the best, can and does often lead to improvement in one\u2019s own ability and regardless as to whether or not you surpass those that you admire and with to be like, Improvement and success although not guaranteed, will often follow as a natural result. But yes, if you do better than your friend that is a bonus, the point being the effort in the process that is important. I enjoy working with a lab partner during practical chemistry work. I found that the ability to designate and execute particular tasks that make up a greater process, doing it efficiently and effectively, is a rewarding feeling.</p> <p>I love working in a small team (granted people are respectful), I find things move much faster with a cooperative effort, and Helping others is something I am naturally inclined to do.</p> <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully it was informative at the very least.</p>"},{"location":"academics/","title":"Academic record","text":"<p>Below are my academic transcripts from the past years, you can also
