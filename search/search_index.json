Education UNISA: BSC Degree in Physics and Chemistry (in progress) Atlantic International University: Degree in Animation Bridge House: Highschool Skills & Experience Educator : Tutoring in math, physics and chemistry. Arts : 3D Animation. Minor experience in Voice acting. Instruments; guitar and bass. Painting; oil on canvas and digital (photoshop). Lab Assistant : Capable lab assistant for setting up apparatus and glassware, titration, A/B extraction etc. Familiar with the general chemistry laboratory environment. Experience Tutoring I have worked as a private, as well as part time employed, tutor since 2020 and honestly If I could I would Teach at a formal institute, as I really enjoy teaching as much as I enjoy learning. Subjects include: University; mathematics, physics and chemistry, and Highschool; mathematics and physical science (physics, chemistry, etc.) This includes letters of reference from past clients. Lab work I must state clearly that as of now (2022) I do not have experience from employment. However, I Do Have Laboratory experience from practical work in my studies, as well as working on my own chemistry projects with my own apparatus and reagents (limited that may be). In order to gain experience, you need employment, but in order to get employment you need experience. Although I am confident that my ability speaks for itself. :fontawesome Skills Lab hand Capable lab assistant for setting up apparatus and glassware, titration, A/B extraction, solvent separation, filtration via pump or gravity and preparing solutions of required concentration.

My love for teaching and explaining concepts to others is ultimately and an excellent understanding of the subjects I have studied, naturally lead me to become a tutor. I find communication with students easy as there I have learnt to adapt my mindset to the age and demographic in question, also in a social setting I enjoy conversation of a wide spectrum of topics of varying diversity. Odd as it may seem, I have had a rather Interesting and long path in life. From art and animation, to the decent into depression, climbing back out and changing my profession, and finally at the end of my studies (for now) in Physics and Chemistry of all things. But I am happy with the choice I have made and the path I have made for myself. Traditionally one usually has one particular field or profession in mind, however If my life was not finite, I really would have liked to have attempted to work in multiple different fields, learn about them and perfect my trade. However, from my view a large part of the world is and its inner workings are rooted in, so it is to me worth devoting my life to. Something that I must admit is that I have a drive to be better than others in my own field, not in a maniacal or unhealthy fashion, just as a measure or standard to reach and if possible, surpass. I hope this honest is not to my own detriment, but what I\u2019m trying to say is that trying ones best to be the best, can and does often lead to improvement in one\u2019s own ability and regardless as to whether or not you surpass those that you admire and with to be like, Improvement and success although not guaranteed, will often follow as a natural result. But yes, if you do better than your friend that is a bonus, the point being the effort in the process that is important. I enjoy working with a lab partner during practical chemistry work. I found that the ability to designate and execute particular tasks that make up a greater process, doing it efficiently and effectively, is a rewarding feeling.","title":"About me"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"I enjoy learning, that is possibly the most prominent aspect I have.
